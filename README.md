# Portfolio
## Shanice Sauceda
 Created a portfolio to display my work for future employers. Including name,contact information, avatar, about me and projects that have been completed. 

##What was done

Beginning with a wireframe on my ideal view of the website I built and html file to include the information needed for the bonestructure of the webpage before glamorizing with css. Flexbox was also incorporated into my css to ensure the page can be viewed on various screen types.
